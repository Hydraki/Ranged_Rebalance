# Ranged_Rebalance

A simple ranged weapon rebalance mod, useful until the experimental archery overhaul is finished and properly balanced. 
The goal was to create a streamline formula for bows and crossbows, making sure none of them are either useless or overpowered.
While all the changes can be found in the "List of Changes" folder, inside the Mod, in short expect the following:

/============
|  Bows
\============
| Pros:
/============
* Slightly more pierce overall (around 2~4 times more on bodkin-like arrows);
* Arrows have flat damage, pierce and range values;
(This means that weak bows, with good arrows, can still be useful)
* Slightly reduced STR requirements. 

\============
| Cons: 
/============
* Damage is nerfed, up to 66% in some cases (expect bows to deal ~8 to ~25 damage);
* Will take slightly longer to fire, after aiming;

/============
|  Crossbows:
\============
| Pros:   
/============
* Higher damage overall;
* Slightly more pierce overall (around 2~4 times more on bodkin-like bolts);
* Heavily reduced Reload times (but still ~3x slower than bows);
* Heavily reduced STR requirements (at the cost of high Reload times)

\============
| Cons: 
/============
* Lower DPS than bows;
* High reload times, compared to Bows, making them awful against groups;
